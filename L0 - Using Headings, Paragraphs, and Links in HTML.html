    <h1>Understanding Web Development Basics</h1>

    <h2>Section 1: What is HTML?</h2>
    <p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard markup language for creating web pages and web applications. It provides the structure of a webpage, using elements like headings, paragraphs, images, and links to organize content. HTML elements are the building blocks of web pages.</p>

    <h3>Section 2: The Role of CSS</h3>
    <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in HTML. CSS is used to style web pages and user interfaces. It covers aspects like colors, fonts, layout, and responsiveness, making web content visually appealing and adaptable to different screen sizes. For more information, you can visit the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS" target="_blank">MDN Web Docs on CSS</a>.</p>

    <h4>Section 3: Introduction to JavaScript</h4>
    <p>JavaScript is a programming language that enables interactive web pages. It allows you to implement complex features on web pagesâ€”things that update content dynamically, control multimedia, animate images, and pretty much everything else. It is an essential component of modern web development, working alongside HTML and CSS to create rich user experiences.</p>
